# Repository for old university projects
A repo for university projects referenced in my portfolio, you can find renders promoting The Last Chance (the name of a game lost to time and deprecated OpenGL library) and HoloRBOT, a library for 3D tracking software developed as my Master's Degree thesis.

You can find further material at https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/qkjmww6ph0xarhdeojobw/ACrE0i1wmOs95H5zpm-RkPo?rlkey=v3k16u0p2eqrudeodktmkcwj6&st=6a0chm4a&dl=0, where I saved the trailer for The Last Chance and two videos documenting HoloRBOT working.

Enjoy!
